<p>HAIVan is a joint research project, partially supported by <a href="http://www.asea-uninet.org/">ASEA-UNINET</a>, 2016</p>
<p> The goal of this project is to research, develop and educate techniques and methods for analyzing and optimizing critical Internet of Things (IoT) software operated under highly volatile and uncertain conditions in developing countries. We focus on IoT software that are used to monitor critical infrastructures, such as water supply and wastewater systems, in smart cities scenarios. Currently, several techniques have been introduced for the development and testing of IoT software used in smart cities. Similarly, training programs for IoT software development are also offered by different institutions. However, most of them are designed for developed environments with the assumption that there exist reliable communication and computational infrastructures. Therefore, these techniques are not working very well in highly volatile and unreliable environments in developing countries in Southeast Asia, like Vietnam, due to unstable infrastructures and harsh natural environmental conditions. As an example, it is very challenging to develop IoT software systems that work very well in very unstable networks, inadequate physical infrastructures for providing reliable monitoring data about wastewater systems in Da Nang city. Therefore, it is difficult to conduct reliable analytics of the wastewater systems in order to optimize wastewater management systems to reduce the operational costs and to reduce environmental impacts of wastewater in the city. In parallel, training programs for IoT software development in developing countries are not adequate due to the lack of specific solutions addressed challenges in these countries. </p>
